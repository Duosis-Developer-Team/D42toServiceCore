# SMAX Response JSON Field Analysis Report

## General Structure
- **entities**: (array) List of entities sent to or returned from SMAX (e.g., Device). Each represents a device.
- **meta**: (object) Contains operation status, error details, and query time.

---

## Fields in the entities Array

Each entity (example: Device):

### entity_type
- **entity_type**: "Device"  
  The type of entity. Here, a server/device.

### properties
- **properties**: (object)  
  All device properties are stored here.  
  Key fields:

| Field Name      | Type      | Description / Example / Usage |
|-----------------|-----------|-------------------------------|
| IpAddresses     | string (JSON) | IP addresses, stored as a JSON string. Can contain one or more IPs. |
| LastUpdateTime  | int       | Last update time (epoch timestamp, milliseconds). |
| OsName          | string    | Operating system name. |
| Id              | string    | Unique device ID in SMAX. |
| Cpus            | string (JSON) | CPU information, stored as a JSON string. Can contain multiple CPUs. |
| DiskDevices     | string (JSON) | Disk information, stored as a JSON string. Can contain multiple disks. |
| DisplayLabel    | string    | Display name/label of the device. |

#### Fields Stored as JSON Strings

- **IpAddresses**:  
  Can contain multiple IP addresses. Each IP can have type, DNS name, routing domain, etc.
- **Cpus**:  
  Can contain multiple CPUs. Each CPU can have type, vendor, speed, core count, etc.
- **DiskDevices**:  
  Can contain multiple disks. Each disk can have name, size, model, type, etc.

### related_properties
- **related_properties**: (object)  
  Used for properties of related entities. Empty in this example.

## meta Field

| Field Name            | Type      | Description |
|-----------------------|-----------|-------------|
| completion_status     | string    | Indicates if the operation was successful (e.g., "OK"). |
| total_count           | int       | Total number of records returned. |
| errorDetailsList      | array     | Error details (empty if no error). |
| errorDetailsMetaList  | array     | Error meta information (empty if no error). |
| query_time            | int       | Query completion time (timestamp). |

## Evaluation and Notes

- **Data Model:**  
  SMAX stores related fields (IP, CPU, Disk, etc.) as JSON strings. These fields must be encoded/decoded when sending to or receiving from the SMAX API.
- **Required Fields:**  
  DisplayLabel, Id, OsName, Cpus, IpAddresses, DiskDevices are generally required.
- **Empty Fields:**  
  Some subfields (e.g., IpType, AuthoritativeDNSName, DiskName) may be empty. Fill as needed.
- **ID Fields:**  
  Each sub-object (IP, CPU, Disk) has a unique Id.
- **Time Field:**  
  LastUpdateTime is stored as epoch in milliseconds.

## Conclusion

The SMAX response structure contains all details of the sent device and its related sub-objects (IP, CPU, Disk) as JSON strings.  
If the operation is successful, `completion_status` is "OK" and error lists are empty.  
This structure is suitable for processing responses from SMAX or transferring data from Device42 to SMAX.
